# Document Inspiration
1. https://gruev.space/
 - I like the initial animation of the site. I was thinking about some sort of intro animation for my site.
 - I like the mouseovers and the animations between page changes as well.
 - Other than the intro, I don't like the spinning box and the controls for it. I also don't like the organization of the site. I think that it's trying a little bit too hard to be creative and it feels a little messy/ hard to follow.
2. https://studiolinear.com/
 - I like the home page of this site. I think the organization is creative and doesn't feel disorganized. I also like the mouseovers.
 - I think it is a little confusing about what we are initially looking at on the home page, I think I would want to create a seperate page for work.
3. http://www.hypepro.tv/
 - I like how this site has pages for everything, it makes the site feel more organized. I think this site is the easiest of the 4 to use/ understand.
4. https://zhenyary.com/
 - I like the initial animation of this page as well as the quick flip through of work on the home page. I would do soemthing similar to this on my own site.
 - I like how there are links for contacting and work that follow as you scroll.
 - I like the scroll down idea and the way that the information presents itself. This is something that I would consider
